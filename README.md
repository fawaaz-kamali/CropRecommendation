Crop Recommendation System
- The goal of this project was to develope a AI-powered crop recommendation system which utilizes simple machine learning and automation to assist farmers in selecting the best crops for each specific field.

- To achieve this we began by:
    • group members identified the parameters needed from each CSV file
    • equations were identified for yield prediction score, and sustanability score
    • roles were split: presentation, front-end, and back-end
